## Sprint 1
A server relays text messages between two clients.

- **Run**

 chat2me/sprint1> ./server <chosen_port>
 chat2me/sprint1> ./client <your_ip_address> <chosen_port>
```
- **Compile**
```
chat2me/sprint1> gcc -o server server.c
chat2me/sprint1> gcc -o client client.c
```

## Sprint 2

A multi-threaded server and two multi-threaded clients


- **Run**
```
 chat2me/sprint2> ./server <chosen_port>
 chat2me/sprint2> ./client <your_ip_address> <chosen_port>
```
- **Compile**
```
chat2me/sprint2> gcc -o server server.c -lpthread
